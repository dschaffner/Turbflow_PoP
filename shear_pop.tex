\begin{abstract}
Continuous control over azimuthal flow and shear in the edge of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) has been achieved using a biasable limiter which has allowed a careful study of the effect of flow shear on pressure-gradient-driven turbulence and transport in LAPD. LAPD rotates spontaneously in the ion diamagnetic direction (IDD); positive limiter bias first reduces, then minimizes (producing a near-zero shear state), and finally reverses the flow into the electron diamagnetic direction (EDD). Degradation of particle confinement is observed in the minimum shearing state and reduction in turbulent particle flux is observed with increasing shearing in both flow directions. Near-complete suppression of turbulent particle flux is observed for shearing rates comparable to the turbulent autocorrelation rate measured in the minimum shear state.  Turbulent flux suppression is dominated by amplitude reduction in low-frequency ($<10$kHz) density fluctuations. An increase in fluctuations for the highest shearing states is observed with the emergence of a coherent mode which does not lead to net particle transport. The variations of density fluctuations are fit well with power-laws and compare favorably to simple models of shear suppression of transport.

\maketitle
While flow shear does provide a source of free energy for instability and turbulence, it can lead to stabilization of pressure-gradient-driven instabilities and a reduction of turbulent transport in magnetized plasmas~\cite{burrell97, terry00}.  The transport barrier in the high-confinement mode, or H-mode, of tokamak operation~\cite{wagner82} is attributed to the spontaneous development of an edge flow layer in which  strong shearing suppresses transport~\cite{burrell97, terry00}.  The direct connection between the H-mode edge flow layer and improved confinement was first established in experiments on the Continuous Current Tokamak (CCT) in which transport barriers were generated by directly driving edge flow using torque due to radial currents driven by biased electrodes~\cite{taylor89}.  Biasing has been used to produce improved confinement in a number of subsequent experiments including toroidal devices~\cite{weynants92,boedo00,silva06} and linear magnetized plasmas~\cite{sakai93,maggs07,carter09}. 

While ample evidence for transport reduction in the presence of sheared flow exists~\cite{burrell99, tynan09} and significant effort and progress has been made in developing a theoretical understanding of the interaction between sheared flow and turbulence, there are still a number of open questions that can be answered by
experiment.  In particular, the exact mechanism behind turbulence modification and transport suppression by shear is still subject to debate: theories present a number of mechanisms including radial decorrelation~\cite{biglari90}, nonlinear reduction of turbulent amplitude~\cite{kim04}, and modification of turbulent cross-phase~\cite{ware96}.  Evidence for all of these mechanisms exists in experimental data~\cite{tynan09}, but a comprehensive experimental dataset establishing in detail the parameter regimes where each mechanism is important has not been acquired.  In part, this is due to
the fact that most datasets on flow-turbulence interaction come from studies of spontaneously generated flow or in cases where precise external control over flow and flow shear is not possible.  A number of basic plasma experiments have utilized biasing techniques to drive
flow and flow shear to study flow driven instabilities (e.g. \cite{amatucci96,jass72}); however, experiments have not been done in which precise external control over flow shear has been achieved in higher-density plasmas with drift-wave turbulence to systematically study the changes in turbulence characteristics and transport.

In this letter, we report on the first experiments in which external control of flow is used to document the response of turbulence and transport to a continuous variation of flow shear, including a zero shear state and a reversal of the flow direction. Shearing rates ($\gamma_{s}= \partial V_{\theta}/\partial r$, where $V_{\theta} = E_r/B$) from zero to up to five times the turbulent autocorrelation rate measured at zero flow shear $(\tau_{ac}^{-1})$ are achieved. Turbulent particle flux is reduced with increasing shearing rate, regardless of the direction of the flow or sign of the flow shear, with significant reduction occuring for $\gamma_{s} \sim \tau_{ac}^{-1}$.  The observed reduction in particle flux is dominated by a decrease in low-frequency ($f < 10$kHz) density fluctuation amplitude. For low frequency fluctuations, the crossphase between density and azimuthal electric field fluctuations remain near zero for all shearing rates.  With higher shear ($\gamma_{s} > \tau_{ac}^{-1}$) we observe the emergence of a coherent mode localized spatially in the region of strong flow. Fluctuations from this mode appear to increase density fluctuations above 10kHz, but do not appear to contribute to particle flux.   

\section{Experimental Setup}

The Large Plasma Device \cite{gek91} (LAPD) is a 17m long, $\sim$60cm diameter cylindrical plasma produced by a barium-oxide coated nickel
cathode. In the experiments reported here, a plasma of density $\sim$$2 \times 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$ and peak temperature of ~8eV is
produced in a uniform solenoidal magnetic field of 1000G.  Measurements of electron density, electron temperature, and potential (both plasma
potential and floating potential) are made using Langmuir probes.  
Measurements of ion saturation current ($I_{\rm sat} \propto n_e \sqrt{T_e}$) and floating
potential ($V_f$) are taken with a 9-tip Langmuir probe (flush-mount
tantalum tips) while temperature and plasma potential are
determined using a swept Langmuir probe. $I_{\rm sat}$ fluctuations are taken as a proxy for density fluctuations for the measurements reported in this work. Density profiles are determined by scaling averaged $I_{\rm sat}$ profiles to line-averaged interferometer measurements of density.  Turbulent particle flux
$\Gamma \propto \left<\tilde{n}_e \tilde{E}_\theta\right>$ is
determined through correlating density fluctuations from one tip
of this probe with
azimuthal electric field fluctuations ($E_\theta$) derived from
floating potential fluctuations on two azimuthally separated tips.
Azimuthal $E\times B$ flow is computed
using the swept-probe-derived plasma potential.  Flows derived using
this technique compare very well to measurements using
Mach probes~\cite{maggs07} and flows derived from time-delay
estimation (TDE) of the velocity of turbulent structures~\cite{holland04}.
  
Biasing experiments have been previously conducted on LAPD in which
edge profile steepening and a reduction in turbulent flux was
observed~\cite{maggs07,carter09}. In these experiments, edge flow was
driven by biasing the vacuum chamber wall with respect to the
plasma source cathode.  Transport reduction occurred only for biases
above a threshold value.  Below the threshold, azimuthal flow was
localized near the biased wall and no flow or flow shear was driven in
the region where drift wave turbulence exists.  Above the threshold,
the flow was able to penetrate radially inward; hence, strong flow and
flow shear, with shearing rates far above the low-flow turbulent
autocorrelation rate, was driven in the region of strong density
gradient.   Recent experiments were successful in achieving more continuous control of potential and cross-field flow in the shadow of a small biased obstacle inserted into the LAPD core plasma~\cite{zhou12}.  Both confinement improvement and degradation (formation of strong density depletions) were observed with the density profile created by the obstacle in this case.  

Motivated by the success of biasing obstacles to control flow, a large
annular aluminum limiter was installed in LAPD. The limiter provides a
parallel boundary condition for the edge plasma and is biased relative
to the cathode of the plasma source to control plasma potential and
cross-field flow.  The limiter is an iris-like design with four
radially movable plates located 2.5m from the cathode as shown
schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:velocity_flowshear}(a).  The limiters
create a 52cm diameter aperture; downstream of the limiter, plasma on
field lines with radial location $r>26$cm has the limiter as a
conducting end parallel boundary condition and plasma on field lines
for $r<26$cm has the anode/cathode of the source region as a parallel
boundary condition.  An electrically floating conducting end mesh
terminates the plasma on the far end of the device.  A capacitor bank
and transistor switch supply a voltage pulse to the limiter.  The bias
pulse lasts 5ms during the flat-top of the $\sim$$15$ms plasma
discharge. The limiter is biased from $\sim$$10$V below to 50V above
the anode potential.  Typically, plasma potential in the core LAPD
plasma (plasma on field lines that connect to the source region) is
very close to the anode voltage and the cathode sits near ground
(vacuum chamber wall).  The anode potential is above the cathode
potential by the discharge voltage, which was $\sim$$40$V during these
experiments.

\end{figure}

Spontaneous azimuthal rotation of the LAPD plasma is observed when the limiters are
unbiased (here the limiters are observed to float to a
potential $\sim 10$V below the anode).  In this state, an edge flow
(peaked just outside the limiter edge) is
observed in the ion diamagnetic drift direction (IDD), as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:velocity_flowshear}(a).  Biasing the limiter positively
with respect to the cathode tends to drive flow in the electron
diamagnetic drift direction (EDD).  As the limiter bias is increased, the
flow in the IDD is first reduced, then brought to separate near-zero flow
and zero flow-shear states, and ultimately reversed with strong EDD flow.

Measurements of profiles of density and particle flux
were made for each bias flow state. Values are averaged over a range
from $r=27$cm to $r=31$cm, a region where average flow and flow shear scale
nearly linearly with limiter bias, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:velocity_flowshear}(b).  All other spatially-averaged
quantities shown in this paper are averaged over the same region in space.

\caption{\label{fig:densgrad} Density gradient length scale versus limiter bias. Inset shows density profile at three bias values.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:densgrad} shows the variation in the spatially-averaged density gradient length scale, $L_{n} = \lvert \nabla \ln n \rvert ^{-1}$ with
increasing limiter bias.  As the limiter bias is increased, reducing
the IDD flow, an increase in the gradient scale length is observed,
indicating a degradation of radial particle confinement. The gradient scale length peaks
when the averaged shearing rate is near zero. As the bias is
increased further, reversing the flow and again increasing the
shearing rate, the gradient gradually steepens and the
scale length is lowered, indicating improved radial particle confinement.

  flux as a function of normalized shearing rate. Filled symbols
  represent points with flow in the IDD. Inset: Measured turbulent particle flux versus
  gradient scale length.}
\end{figure}

The observed variation of $\langle L_{n} \rangle$ with bias is best
organized when compared to the shearing rate, $\gamma_{s}$, as is
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sheargradflux}(a).   The shearing rate is
normalized to the autocorrelation rate of density fluctuations
measured in the zero-shear state.  An autocorrelation rate of $\tau_{ac}^{-1} \approx $ 28kHz $(\tau_{ac} \approx 36\mu s)$ is calculated by taking the half-width at half-maximum of a Hilbert transform of the $I_{\rm sat}$
autocorrelation function.  Confinement improvement (decreased $\langle
L_n \rangle$) occurs continuously and gradually with increasing
$\gamma_{s}$ and reaches saturation for $\gamma_{s} \approx \tau_{ac}^{-1}$ (a normalized $\gamma_{s}$ of 1).  The profile steepening
appears to be largely independent of the direction of the flow (or radial electric field): IDD (filled points) and EDD (open points) flow cases follow the same trend when plotted against normalized shearing rate.

Conversely, the scale length changes do not line up along a single curve if compared to flow rather than flow shear. Fig~\ref{fig:Lnvsflow} shows the same quantities of scale length versus the flow measured at the limiter edge for each bias. Points around the flow minimum are not symmetric; this is physically due to the fact that the minimum shearing rate does not coincide with the minimum flow point. Fortunately this difference allows us to observe the fact that is is flow shear, not necessarily flow, that establishes a maximual density gradient, or minimal confinement.

Measured changes in turbulence and turbulent particle flux are
consistent with the observed changes in the density profile.  The
turbulent particle flux can be written\cite{powers74}:
\begin{equation}
\Gamma = \frac{2}{B} \int^{\infty}_{0} \lvert n(f) \rvert \lvert E_{\theta}(f) \rvert \gamma_{(n,E_{\theta})}(f) \cos [\phi_{(n,E_{\theta})}(f)] df
\label{eq:fluxint}
\end{equation}
where $n(f)$ and $E_\theta(f)$ are the Fourier transforms of
the density and azimuthal electric field fluctuations;
$\gamma_{(n,E_\theta)}$ is the coherency between density and electric
field; and $\phi_{(n,E_\theta)}$ is the cross-phase angle between
density and electric field.

Fig~\ref{fig:particlefluxprofiles} shows profiles of these particle flux for varying bias states. The natural state represented by the black curve shows that measured flux peaks in the region of density gradient. As bias is increased, shearing increases and both peak and overall flux increases reaching a maximum at bias 7. Beyond this bias, the flux is generally decreased across the entire radius except for a very narrow region just inside the limiter edge.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{particlefluxprofiles.eps}}
\caption{\label{fig:sheargradflux}}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:sheargradflux}(b) shows the spatially-averaged turbulent
particle flux as a function of normalized shearing rate.  The
turbulent flux decreases continuously with increasing shearing rate;
however the observed decrease is slightly slower than that observed
for $L_n$.  The inset in Figure~\ref{fig:sheargradflux}(b) shows that the variation in
turbulent flux is correlated with the changes in $L_n$ (but scales in a way
that is inconsistent with Fick's law using a fixed diffusion coefficient).  The
trend in reduced particle flux is the same for either direction of
flow (IDD or EDD).  The cause for the reduction in turbulent particle
flux can be explored by considering individual terms in the integrand
of Eqn.~\ref{eq:fluxint}.

Density fluctuations were reduced significantly with increasing
shearing in these experiments.  Figure~\ref{fig:powercontour}(a) shows
changes in the spatially-averaged density fluctuation spectrum
with shearing rate.  The shearing rate is signed in this figure, and
negative shearing rates occur for flow in the IDD. Most of the power
is located in frequencies $<10$kHz and in this range, power decreases
overall with increasing shearing rate.  A decrease of about one order
of magnitude in fluctuation power is seen between the minimum shear
state and the high shear regime where $L_n$ and particle flux are
minimized; this is made clearer in Figure~\ref{fig:powercontour}(b).  At
higher shearing rates, $\gamma_{s} \gtrsim \tau_{ac}^{-1}$, a coherent
mode emerges.  The frequency of the mode increases with shearing rate
and the fluctuation amplitude is localized to the peak of the
azimuthal flow.

\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{figure4.eps}}
\caption{\label{fig:powercontour} (a) Contour plot of log $I_{\rm sat}$/density fluctuation power versus shearing rate and frequency. (b) Power spectra for four different values of shearing rate.}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:fluxcomps}(a) shows the reduction in total density fluctuation amplitude with shear in two frequency bands: all frequencies below 100kHz in black and all frequencies above 10kHz in red. With the emergence of the coherent mode, the
high frequency fluctuation amplitude does show an increasing trend at higher shearing
rates but there is a strong overall decrease in fluctuation amplitude with shearing.
A reduction is also seen in $E_\theta$ fluctuation amplitude, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:fluxcomps}(b); however this reduction is weaker than
observed in density fluctuations.  The cross-phase between
$n$ and $E_\theta$ does not change significantly with
shearing. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:fluxcomps},
$\cos[\phi_{(n,E_\theta)}] \sim 1$ for all shearing rates.  For
higher frequencies ($f > 10$kHz), the cross-phase does change with
shearing, with $\cos[\phi_{(n,E_\theta)}]$ trending toward zero at
higher shear.  This crossphase change explains why the coherent mode
that emerges at higher shearing rate does not contribute to an
increase in the particle flux.  The coherency between $n$ and
$E_\theta$ also decreases with shearing rate, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:fluxcomps}.  Overall, the decrease in flux is primarily
due to a decrease in turbulent amplitude.  This observation is distinct from previous work with flows driven by vacuum-chamber-wall
biasing on LAPD. In those experiments, turbulent amplitude decreased little while the
turbulent cross-phase experienced a significant change, leading to
reduced particle flux~\cite{carter09}.  In the experiments reported
here, the magnetic field is higher (1000G versus 400G) and normalized
shearing rates are lower (near unity).  Cross-phase change is expected
in cases with very strong shearing ($\gamma_{s} \gg \tau_{ac}^{-1}$)~\cite{terry01}.  Future experiments will explore the
variation of the turbulent response to higher normalized shearing
through changing plasma parameters, in particular magnetic field.

\end{figure}

\section{Field Comparison}

Plotting flux versus shearing rate for both 1000G and 500G, without normalizing either shearing rate to the autocorrelation rate, shows that flux decreases at nearly the same rate with shearing.

\section{Correlation Planes}

Some theories suggest that flow shear is expected to produce radial decorrelation of turbulence,
breaking up turbulent eddies into smaller radial scales which in turn results in decreased turbulent fluctuations~\cite{biglari90}.
We measure the radial correlation length in the plane of the plasma by computing a two-dimensional turbulent correlation functions sing
two probes: one probe is held fixed in space (phase reference) and
correlating its signals against a second probe, axially separated
from the first, which is moved shot-to-shot in a plane perpendicular
to the magnetic field.  The radial correlation length, $\Delta r_c$,
is derived from the radial width of the Hilbert transform of the
correlation function (half-radial-width and half-maximum at the
location of peak correlation). We can just as easily extract a correlation length in the y-diretion, representing the extent in the azimuthal direction. This length can be used for calculating an estimate of the azimuthal wavenumber, $k_{\theta}$, as well as the azimuthal mode number, M.

Fig.~\ref{fig:corrplanes} shows the cross-correlation contour plot for three shearing regimes---a)unbiased, IDD flow, b)no-shear, c)high flow/shear---normalized to the maximum correlation within each regime. The reference tip is located at 30cm, just beyond the edge of the limiter and within the spatial averaging region. The most striking change occurs between the no-shear state and a high shear state; the correlation function shifts from a fairly circular shape to radially narrowed and azimuthally elongated structure. In the high bias case, a series of structures can be seen located directly at the limiter edge. This is believed to be a mode-pattern caused by the mode that appears at high bias. Fig.~\ref{fig:filteredhighbias} shows the same correlation plane but with the frequencies at which the mode is observed removed leaving the correlation structure unaffected.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{radcorr}}
\caption{\label{fig:filteredhighbias} }
\end{figure}

Accumulating radial correlation lengths from correlation functions at various shearing states, it can be shown that the radial correlation length 
decreases with increasing shearing, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:radcorr}.

%Discuss rad correlation length vs grad scale length

At higher shearing rate, a coherent mode
pattern appears (as shown in the rightmost inset plot) in addition to
the primary correlation peak (the coherent mode is
pattern shifted inward of the reference probe location which was $r=30$cm).  The coherent
mode does lead to an increasing trend in the radial correlation length
at higher shear, but the overall trend is a substantial reduction
($\gtrsim 2$) in the radial correlation length from the no shear state.

  reference probes at 28,29,30,31 or 32cm with $\gamma_{s}$ averaged over measured $\Delta r_{c}$.  Inset shows 2D correlation
  structure for 3 cases: unbiased (spontaneous flow), minimum flow
  shear and strong EDD flow.}
\end{figure}



\section{Wavenumber and Spectral Density}

The azimuthal (or polodial) wavenumber can be extracted from the probe data using  a two-tipped Langmuir probe technique~\cite{beall82} (see Appendix?) and combined with frequency information to create spectral density contour plots and with radial distance to calculate distributions of polodial eigenmodes (M-numbers) present in the plasma. Polodial eigenmodes---M-numbers---are modified signficantly as a function of shearing rate as mode size, mode power and mode direction are all changed over the course of a scan. The countor of Fig.~\ref{fig:m_spec_vs_bias}a presents a summary of the M-number distribution as a function of bias with cuts show below in b) averaged over the same radial range as before, 27 to 31cm. Positive and negative values of M-number are inherited from their corresponding wavenumber, k, which can have a propgation direction. In this arragement, negative values correspond to modes which propagte in the electron diamagnetic drift direction while postive values are modes propagating in the ion diamagnetic drift direction. Thus, in the unbiased case, it is clear that the dominant modes in this section of the plasma are progagating primarily in the EDD which is consistant with pressure-gradient driven modes. Furthermore, modes of M-numbers 50-60 have the most power associated with them, which is consistant with the structure size found from correlation plane measurements.

As shearing is zeroed, there is a trend toward more power in the EDD modes, again with the peak modes sitting in the range of 50-60. Again this is consistant with the fact that in zero flow and shearing regime, only pressure-gradient modes would be expected to be present. As the flow and shearing is increased just past the no flow region, significant changes begin to be apparent. First, there is an overall reduction in fluctuation power across all modes which reflects the decrease in $I_{sat}$ fluctuation power with shearing rate. Second, the modes that remain begin to be reduced in mode number and more power appears in positive M-numbers. This suggests that as the shearing is increased, the structure size of the turbulence is being elongated in the azimuthal direction which is again consistant with observed correlation plane data. Moreover, the appear of power in the IDD modes suggest the presense of instabilities other than pressure-gradient modes which are not confined to progate in the EDD---namely, this is highly suggested of the appearence of flow or flow shear driven modes such as rotational interchange modes or Kelvin-Helmholtz modes.

M-number analysis sheds some light on the mode that appears in the strongly sheared regime. Fig.~\ref{fig:m_spec_vs_freq} shows a pure spectral density plot of isat mode frequency versus M-number. The power from each position and bias are stacked. While the majority of the power is located in the EDD propagating modes, there does appear to be a branch that juts out in the IDD. Comparing the frequencies of this branch with that of the mode observed in fluctution data and correlation plane data suggest that this mode propagates in the IDD and thus would not be a pressure-gradient driven mode.

\section{Biasing Circuit and Setup}

The biasing circuit consists of a 0.2F, 450V capacitor bank that is pulse discharged through an isolated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) switch. An 250V, 1.5A Agilent network controlled power supply sets the voltage on the capacitor bank. The discharge circuit, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:VbyBias}, supplies a voltage to the limiters through the capacitor bank/IGBT circut and referenced to the cathode of the plasma discharge circuit. A $0.2 \Omega$ wire resistor is placed in series in order to monitor the current of the bias discharge, but the circuit has an overall resistance of about $0.7 \Omega$. Since the discharge current can run into the tens of amperes, the overall voltage applied to the limiters tends to be much less than the power supply can apply as indicated by Fig.~\ref{fig:VbyBias}. 

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{VbyBias}}
\caption{\label{fig:VbyBias} blah}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{IV_curves}}
\caption{\label{fig:IV_curves} blah}
\end{figure}

An I-V curve of the measured current through the biasing circuit as a function of power supply voltage is shown in Fig~\ref{fig:IV_curves} for two different runs. The curve is Ohmic like for voltages above 30V, with a slope consistent with constant resistance on the order of 1.5\Omega s suggesting that the plasma part of the circuit has a resistance of approximately $0.7\Omega$. When the power supply voltage is less than the floating potential of the plasma (here about 30V), no current flows.

The anode cathode discharge circuit of LAPD is similar to the biasing discharge circuit in that it is a capacitor bank controlled by an IGBT switch however, the current that is pulsed through this circuit is on the order of kiloamperes rather than the hundred or so amperes of the biasing circuit. The plasma discharge circuit is also generally isolated from chamber ground so that the discharge voltage difference between the anode and cathode, though fairly constant, can float in reference to chamber ground. For most plasma experiments on LAPD , this is  not a big issue as experiments are typically conducted in the core of the plasma and core potential versus boundary potentials do not play a significant role. However, in the biasing experiments, this voltage difference can potentially influence edge flows and so some attempt has been made to fix this issue.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{an_cath}}
\caption{\label{fig:an_cath} blah}
\end{figure}

In these experiments, the cathode is referenced to the plasma ground through a 25W, $2.3\Omega$ resistor with the expectation that the cathode will stay near ground. In practice, however, the cathode typically settles on a potential that is about 10-15V below chamber ground resulting in approximately 5 amperes of current flowing from ground to the cathode. This potential, though, has been observed at many voltages with respect to ground shifting in a range from 5V to 35V below ground over the course weeks and/or months between different run campaigns or even between days within a run campaign as seen in this particular data set shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:an_cath} where the first curve was taken approximately two days before the second data set.

This result is somewhat unsurprising as anode-cathode circuit's reference to ground is dependant on the overall current's path to ground. Given a 5kA plasma discharge, approximately half of this current will complete the circuit loop through the anode while the other half will reach ground through the plasma and then through the chamber. A connection to ground on the order of a few 10s of amps is not likely to make much of a dent in this procedure, but methods for getting the cathode potential controllable are still underway. Fortunately, however, the limiter method of producing flow appears to not be affected by this variability in cathode potential with respect to ground. In these experiments, the flow under most scrutiny is the flow that appears in the region between the core and the limiters rather than between the core and the far chamber edge. Since the limiters are referenced directly to the cathode, the potential differences that matter are those between the cathode, anode and limiters rather than between any of these elements and ground.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centerline{
\includegraphics[width=8.5cm]{LimAn_vs_PS}}
\caption{\label{fig:LimAn_vs_PS} blah}
\end{figure}

We can show that while not terrible consistent from run to run, the variations in the cathode potential do not have a significant influence on the flow states under investigation. What about the consistency of the limiter potentials themselves? Figure x shows a comparison of limiter voltage as a function of power supply voltage for three different runs (Sets 1 and 2 are from the same run, two days apart, while Feb12 is from a run eight months after those of Set1 and 2). Though each is offset by a different cathode potential, it is clear that each curve is not exactly the same when plotted as a function of power supply bias. Furthermore, this difference is not alleviated when the cathode/anode potential is accounted for. Fig.~\ref{LimAn_vs_PS} shows the difference between anode and limiter voltages as a function of power supply voltage (recall that anode and cathode potential differences are constant with respect to bias). 

Even in this case, the curves do not line up. However, an important observation can be made by looking at the density fluctuation data

The data collection for the June 2011 run was done in two main parts. The first part took mach probe flow, triple probe isat, te, and vf, and Reynolds Stress measurements for two fields, 1000G and 500G. The second part took swept plasma potential and te data, 2D flux measurements and B-dot data. In the first set, the voltage of the anode, cathode, limiters, bias output and annulus were monitored while the second set took only cathode and limiter voltage data.

In examining the fluctuation power of one of the 2D Flux probe isat tips from set 2 and comparing it to the power of the isat tip of the triple probe of set 1 it became apparent that there was a slight difference in the features of the contours. A contour plot of log fluctuation isat power as a function of bias number and frequency is show below first for the 2D flux probe data. The power is averaged over the radial range of 27cm to 31cm.

It is clear that a peak in the fluctuation power occurs at about bias 7 which corresponds to the biasing state for the minimum amount of shearing observed. Thus this plot is consistent with the idea that decreased shearing results in more fluctuation power. As one moves away from this bias state in either direction, especially below 10kHz, the overall power decreases showing that power decreases with increased shear.  Comparing this plot to a similar one made using triple probe isat data from set 1 shows a slightly different picture.

The appears to be an overall similarity in the changing power going up in Bias Number. There is a peak in fluctuation power at about Bias 9, two biases higher than the flux2D probe,  but then the power decreases with increasing bias. Evidence of a coherent mode is also seen in this plot, but it does not seem as distinct as in the Flux 2D data.  Also, there appears to be more power in the unbiased state (bias 0) in the range of 5-10kHz than there was in the flux2D data.

Finally, we show the same plot for the density fluctuation data from the February 2012 run.

If we compare the corresponding bias voltages at which the fluctuations peak with the voltage difference between the anode and limiters, as indicated by the dashed crosshairs, there finally appears a consistent metric across runs. That is, the peak density fluctuations, and as has been shown, the minimum shearing regime, occurs when the limiter voltages reaches a value approximately 5V below that of the anode. This presumable can be interpreted as the point where the plasma potential influenced by the anode/cathode boundary and the limiter boundary respectively are equal and thus no flow or flow shear is observed in the core/limiter edge region. In this way, regardless of how the anode-cathode circuit orients itself with respect to the chamber, or how the limiter potential situates itself with respect to the anode, the minimum shearing point can be located.

\section{Comparison to Theory}

Lastly, we add a comparison of our data to a simple theory, the
Biglari-Diamond-Terry (BDT) model~\cite{biglari90}, which predicts a
power-law scaling with shearing rate of the turbulent
amplitude of the form: $\left(\gamma_{s}/\tau_{ac}^{-1}\right)^{-\alpha}$. As seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:fluxcomps}, a best fit of $\alpha = 0.530$ compares
favorably to the BDT prediction of $\alpha = 2/3$ for the reduction in
density fluctuation amplitude. 
It should be noted, however, that the
BDT model is fairly simple and the validity of its assumptions is
questionable for the experimental conditions reported here.  In
particular, as the shearing rate is increased in LAPD, the density
profile is changing (in BDT a fixed drive is considered).  Future work
will focus on direct comparisons to more comprehensive models of shear
suppression, including comparisons to two-fluid simulations using the
BOUT++ 3D turbulence code~\cite{umansky11}.  

This letter presents the first experiments in which the response of
pressure-gradient-driven turbulence to a continuous
variation of shearing rate, including a near-zero flow shear state and
a reversal in the direction of flow, is studied.  Increased shearing
improves radial particle confinement regardless of the direction of
the azimuthal flow or sign of the flow shear. The observed reduction of
turbulent particle flux with shear is attributed to a reduction in the
amplitude of density fluctuations. These
experiments were performed at a fixed set of plasma parameters (fixed
magnetic field, neutral pressure, discharge power); future work will
explore the variation in turbulent response to shear as these
parameters are varied.
